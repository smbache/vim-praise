*vim-praise*	Plugin for getting praise

Take it all in! And then Vim like crazy...

Add more templates with g:praise_more_templates. This should
be an array with strings. Use placeholders {{adjective}}, {{adverb}},
{{type}}, {{exclam}} to get random words. {{anadjective}}, {{anadverb}},
{{atype}} versions exists for when the particle a/an is needed too.
If you want to overwrite the default templates use g:praise_templates
instead.
